## Student Outcomes
After completing this assignment, students will be able to
* Assignment 1: explain how a cache works and apply BST tree to search in a simple cache
* Assignment 2: get familiar with hash techniques, select and manipulate data structures suitable to desired needs.

## Cache replacement Policies
As the size of a cache is limited, when the cache is full and a new data is
inserted into the cache for future requests, an existing data in the cache must
be selected by the cache replacement policy and it is removed to have place for
the new data. There are many cache replacement policies, all the below policies will be used in 2 assignments:
* FIFO (First In First Out)
* LIFO (Last In First Out)
* MFU (Most Frequently Used)
* LFU (Least Frequently Used)
* MFRU (Most Frequently Recently Used)
* LFRU (Most Frequently Recently Used)

## The results
* Assignment 1: 100/100
* Assignment 2: 95/100
